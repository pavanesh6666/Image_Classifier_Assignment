# AI Image Classification using CNN (MNIST)

## Objective
This project demonstrates a simple AI-based image classification system that can classify images into basic categories using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

The model is trained on the MNIST dataset, which contains handwritten digit images from 0 to 9.

## Technologies Used
- Python  
- TensorFlow / Keras  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  

## Features
- Loads image dataset
- Preprocesses images (normalization and reshaping)
- Trains a CNN model
- Predicts the class of a sample image
- Displays the prediction result visually
- Saves the trained model

## Installation
Install required libraries:
```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib


## How to Run
Steps to Run:
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies
   pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib
3. Run the notebook:
   Image_Classifier_Assignment.ipynb




Model Accuracy:
~99% on test dataset
