# AI Image Classification using CNN (MNIST)

## Objective
This project demonstrates a simple AI-based image classification system that can classify images into basic categories using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

The model is trained on the MNIST dataset, which contains handwritten digit images from 0 to 9.

## Technologies Used
- Python  
- TensorFlow / Keras  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  

## Features
- Loads image dataset
- Preprocesses images (normalization and reshaping)
- Trains a CNN model
- Predicts the class of a sample image
- Displays the prediction result visually
- Saves the trained model

## Installation

Install required libraries:

```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib
```

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/pavanesh6666/Image_Classifier_Assignment.git
```

2. Move into the project folder:
```bash
cd Image_Classifier_Assignment
```

3. Open Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```

4. Open `Image_Classifier_Assignment.ipynb` and run all cells.

## Model Accuracy

- Training Accuracy: ~99%
- Validation Accuracy: ~99%
- Model performs well on MNIST handwritten digit dataset.
- Sample prediction output is shown visually.
